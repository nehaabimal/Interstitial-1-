### Notes

Fiction, Non-Fiction and Counterfactuals –

Poetry and archaeological writing – hoaxes

Propositional knowledge

Emotional content, resonance, connection, experiential

Creative expression for archaeology

Agent based simulation (behaviour, – Poetry} featuring individuals can use real, personalized, properties and behaviours taken directly from these databases. The results deliver refined optimization by providing a precise, easy, and up to date way to model, forecast, and compare scenarios.

ABM – Speculative fiction with a historical starting point, realm of possibility

Historian’s method/thinking – primary and secondary sources, probability and evidence

Saidiya Hartman’s Critical Fabulation vs Creative Non Fiction – Atlantic Slave Trade, Venus

Formats – Impact

Fabula – fables

Subjunctive Tense – things that might have been otherwise

Playing and rearranging elements of the story to create divergent and contested views

Construction of the past

‘narrative restraint’

Filling gaps in history with background knowledge

Imagine what cannot be said

-       Multimodal

-       Multiple narratives through different media (Interviews, images, blog posts)

Interlinking ideas 
Networks - implications for knowledge 

"**As We May Think**" is a 1945 essay by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush "Vannevar Bush") which has been described as visionary and influential, anticipating many aspects of [information society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society "Information society"). It was first published in _[The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic "The Atlantic")_ in July 1945 and republished in an abridged version in September 1945—before and after the [atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"). Bush expresses his concern for the direction of scientific efforts toward destruction, rather than understanding, and explicates a desire for a sort of [collective memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_memory "Collective memory") machine with his concept of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex "Memex") that would make knowledge more accessible, believing that it would help fix these problems. Through this machine, Bush hoped to transform an information explosion into a knowledge explosion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think#cite_note-Wardrip-1)

STORYTELLING 
Virtual worlds 
extended cognition 
monuments, artifacts- extended public cognition 

Sites of public history 
(eg. Disneyland? - idealized, American culture, stories that people in power tell) 

IKEA - archive, Ursula Lindiquist
arhcive - public and private, authority 
Swedish nationalism and identity 
Social democracy
- forced to read things in a paticular way - 

   
**EXCERPT** - The IKEA store has become one of the world’s most recognized and reproduced archives of national culture in the global marketplace, necessitating a critical reading of its spatial narrative. This article engages in a historicized reading of the culturally encoded space of the IKEA store, of which they were 285 in nearly 40 countries by the end of 2008. 

It argues that the IKEA store helps construct, reproduce, and disseminate a narrative of Swedish exceptionalism worldwide.

This narrative showcases Sweden’s image as a peaceful, homogenous, and industrious little nation, exemplifying Enlightenment ideals of social and economic progress while avoiding implication in the Enlightenment’s more violent aspects. 

This article engages Derrida’s formulation of archival violence to demonstrate how these hidden histories disrupt this archive’s dominant narrative. Recovering these histories is particularly important given recent renewed faith in an essential “Swedishness” that has emerged in response to non-Western immigration in Sweden

- Read the site through movement 
- House of Memory
- Space - sequence of what comes next
- Sites of memory
- Immersion, multisensory, engagement BUT need for intersection with storytelling 

**MOVEMENT AND ENCHANTMENT**
Enchantment - Deep time into the everyday 

- Narrative structure - experience of time and social exsistence 
- Museums convey authority through existence 
- Need for context - Out of Africa (glorification of colonialism)
- Repatriation of artifacts 
- Master narrative - authority 

- FIGURE 1 - linear nodal progression
- FIGURE 2 - nodal network structure} DIGITAL EXPERIENCES. 
- branching narrative - collection of linear nodal structure, some choices, collage of information - many stories of past, does not demo relationships, connections 
- Gallery vision 
- active emergent narrative - it responds to you, new pathaways, new visions, attendee changes the story itself, like agent based simulation model 
- Voice recognition - stop moving, people who don't get into the history books 
- Representations of history - told through sound. 
- You can change the media form and not change the narrative structure
- Generating stories through space 
- Passive linear progression - teller is in a position of power

- MULTIVOCALITY 
- POWER OF REPLAY - deeper engagement
- Visitor changes to someone who makes content, makes history through INQUIRY

Videogames in History 

GAME HISTORY 
VGs - 60ish years old,
Game studies - 30 years old 

What's a game? 

- Walking simulators 
- Exploration, interaction, rules/guidance
- Aarseth and Grabarczyk - 9 definitions (physical, structural, communicational, mental)
- ASSEMBLAGES (Game as a whole) 
- ARTICULATION 
- AURAS - greater marketability, well known, widespread (commerical, cultural) (pirated games - preservation) - more aura? Influential in gaming community 

History and games 
- historians studying games - 10 years 
- History as a setting 
- Historial VGs present the past as one or more historical problem spaces - fictional history 
- GOOD HISTORY? Propaganda (military) or fun? 
- Financed by military 
- First historical VGs - Oregon Trail (1971) and The Sumerian Game (1964) - teletype 

- Civilization - playing imperalism 
- Perpetuating myths? 

ACCURATE? Authenticity? 

- Accuracy - exact in your representation, Being faithful to the original (reproduce the original)
- Sincerity, trustworthiness, CREDIBILILITY - AUTHENTICITY (original is put forward)
- CIV 5 - Zulu, preferred religion: protestantism 
- CIV 6 - Cree as a colonial power
- Eugenics, programmed preffered cultures, inherent racism embedded in the game 
- Discovery Tour - educational? 

BLENDING FACTUAL AND COUNTERFACTUAL 
- Return of the Obra Dinn
7 Cities of Gold (1984) - colonialism, conquistadores, winning through war (genocide)
Easier to win thru trade and cooperation 
Accurate simulation? Gamefying genocide?
